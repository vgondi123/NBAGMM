# Archetyping NBA Players With A Gaussian Mixture Model
This project explores the use of probabilistic clustering to identify interpretable player archetypes (e.g., off-the-dribble scorers, stretch bigs, elite wing defenders) from 2024â€“2025 NBA player statistics.

## Goals
- Cluster NBA players based on statistical profiles to uncover meaningful archetypes
  - lsuetetr rf f
- Implement a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from scratch
- Extend to a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM)

## Current Progress
- âœ… Data collection and preprocessing
- âœ… Initial GMM implementation with Dirichlet prior
- ðŸ”„ Currently evaluating cluster quality
- ðŸ”œ Planning to implement DPGMM for more flexible modeling
- ðŸ”œ Adding mathematical derivations and formal explanation
