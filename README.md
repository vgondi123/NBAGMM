# Archetyping NBA Players With A Gaussian Mixture Model
This project explores the use of probabilistic clustering to identify interpretable player archetypes (e.g., off-the-dribble scorers, stretch bigs, elite wing defenders) from 2024â€“2025 NBA player statistics.

## Goals
- Cluster NBA players based on statistical profiles to uncover player archetypes
  - Helps teams identify players suited for specific roles to aid team-building  
  - Can be extended to project college playersâ€™ potential roles in the NBA  
  - Highlights overlooked players by revealing their play style  
  - Gives fans a clearer picture of the different player types in the league
- Implement a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for clustering
  - Enables soft clustering, allowing players to partially belong to multiple archetypes rather than forcing hard assignments  
  - Models clusters with different distributions and shapes, capturing more complex, realistic patterns in player data  
  - Offers greater interpretability than methods like KMeans by providing full statistical profiles for each cluster
- Extend to a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) to automatically infer the number of clusters  
  - The exact number of NBA player archetypes is unknown and likely fluid across seasons  
  - Allows the data to determine the appropriate number of clusters rather than setting it manually

## Current Progress
- âœ… Data collection and preprocessing
- âœ… Initial GMM implementation
- ðŸ”„ Currently evaluating cluster quality
- ðŸ”œ Planning to implement DPGMM for more flexible modeling
- ðŸ”œ Adding mathematical derivations and formal explanation
